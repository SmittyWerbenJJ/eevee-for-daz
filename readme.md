# eevee_for_daz

My attempt of having unified shaders for daz characters inside blender (eevee)

where are the options/how to use:
- import a Genesis8 or Genesis8.1 character from daz into blender.
- go to the material tabs and open the Material Specials
- the menu `convert materials for daz characters` contains all options for this addon
